I watched the full video of the C language tutorial by Bro Code and made easy-to-read notes of it.
I highly recommend watching his video on Youtube btw.
Initially, I made this folder as a personal project, just for taking notes.
But now, I have decided to make it a github repo.
You can use this as a tool to re-learn the C language, or for understanding the language with more clarity.
*** I DO NOT recommend using it as a tool for learning the C language ***
I highly recommend watching Bro Code's video on Youtube as it as helped me out a TON.
